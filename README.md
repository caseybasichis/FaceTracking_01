# Recording app demo

App features a button to cycle and display media (jpg, but should be jpg/mp3/m4a).
Cycling the media, starts a new background recording.
It should record audio/video/ArKit_face_mocap data.

Cycling and recording audo + face mocap works.

I am struggling to capture the video stream as well.
Also concerned about performance.
